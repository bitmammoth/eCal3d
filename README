This is ecal3d, a library for model export, model loading, and
bone-based animation.  It is a direct derivative of cal3d, which can
be found at cal3d.sourceforge.net.  The modifications that make ecal3d
different from cal3d were written primarily by Joshua Yelon, lead
developer for eGenesis.  You can find updated versions of this library
by going to egenesis.com and looking for the "downloads" web page.

  Everything in the calexp directory is licensed under the GPL.
  The file "caluserdata.h" in the andy directory is public domain.
  All the various READMEs, including this one, are public domain.

WINDOWS VERSION NOTES
---------------------
* Here are the files you can produce using the makefile provided:

  cal3dx.dll - a version of the library compatible with ATITD
  calexp3.dlo - an exporter plugin for 3DSMAX 3.
  calexp4.dlo - an exporter plugin for 3DSMAX 4.
  
  To compile these files, you will need to change directory to
  the build directory, and type 'nmake cal3dx.dll' or the like.

* The makefile contains many rules for building various things for
  which we haven't given you source code.  That is because the makefile
  is actually the entire makefile for "A Tale in the Desert".
  Simply ignore the other junk.

* It is possible to provide "user data fields" when compiling
  ecal3d.  User data fields are inserted into the ecal3d structs without
  question.  As a rule, they are not accessed by ecal3d itself, but
  are used to store various data by the caller of ecal3d.  ATITD
  takes advantage of this mechanism, the file andy/caluserdata.h defines
  a number of fields needed by the ATITD client.

* The source code is fairly portable - it has been compiled with
  visual C 6, visual C 7, and gcc.  It would probably compile under
  most compilers, since it contains very little that is OS dependent.
  However, I have not tested anything other than Visual C 6 myself,
  and the Makefile provided is primarily for Visual C 6.  For it to
  work, you must have the command line version of the compiler in your
  path.  You also need the cygwin utilities, or at least the
  commands "cp", "mv", "rm" and a few others.

* If you want to build the 3DSMAX 3 exporter, you'll need to copy
  the 3DSMAX 3 SDK (all headers and libraries) into the directory
  maxsdk3. If you want to build the 3DSMAX 4 exporter, you'll need to
  copy the 3DSMAX 4 SDK (all headers and libraries) into the directory
  maxsdk4.  If you use 3DSMAX 5, you'll need to use the 3DSMAX 4 exporter.
  It is compatible with 3DSMAX 5.

LINUX/OSX VERSION NOTES
-----------------------
* I have included a basic makefile with all the "A Tale in the Desert"
  rules ripped out.  Please let me know if you have problems using this
  makefile.

* It is possible to provide "user data fields" when compiling
  ecal3d.  User data fields are inserted into the ecal3d structs without

* The source code is fairly portable - it has been compiled with
  GCC 2.9x and GCC 3.x (up to 3.4).  It would probably compile under
  most compilers, since it contains very little that is OS dependent.
  and the Makefile provided is primarily for Gnu make. NOTE: The client
  is currently built for release on GCC 2.96, if you wish to use a replacement
  version of eCal3d, you MUST use GCC 2.96 to ensure compatibility.

* The viewer has was contributed by a user of the library a while ago,
  it has not been tested to even make sure it compiles in a while. Patches
  and updates are welcome.  Send them to pluribus@pluribus.org and I will
  test them and integrate them. It requires GLUT or FreeGLUT to build.

* eGenesis offers nothing in the way of support for eCal3d for the viewer
  and users of altered versions of ecal3d with ATITD get to keep all pieces
  if it breaks.
